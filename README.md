# surveytrack

Surveytrack is an open-source tool for research teams to bundle multiple surveys and track participant progress across survey sets. 
This tool was created by [richard-parayno](https://github.com/richard-parayno) to support the research efforts of [UXPH](https://uxph.org), the largest non-profit organization by and for the Filipino design community. 

The project is currently under active development, so expect breaking changes. 

## Dependencies
- Ruby 3.3.6
- Rails 8.0.1

## How to run surveytrack in dev mode
1. Make sure you have Ruby 3.3.6 and the `rails` gem installed on your local machine.
